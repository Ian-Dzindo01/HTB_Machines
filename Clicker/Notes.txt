Rpcbind on port 111. Couple of nfs opened, might be able to use those.
Cannot find ypbind running on here.
Seems like there are no interesting subfolders on the site, after enumeration with dirb and dirsearch.
Moving on with the nfs exploit https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topics/penetration-testing/exploiting-nfs-share/
/mnt/backups seems to be mountable
Got access to /mnt/backup folder.
