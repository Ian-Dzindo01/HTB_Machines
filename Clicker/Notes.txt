Rpcbind on port 111. Couple of nfs opened, might be able to use those.
Cannot find ypbind running on here.
Seems like there are no interesting subfolders on the site, after enumeration with dirb and dirsearch.
Moving on with the nfs exploit https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topics/penetration-testing/exploiting-nfs-share/
/mnt/backups seems to be mountable
Got access to /mnt/backup folder.
Found credentials for the database. Dont seem to do much. After lookin around the code found an interesting comment in the save.php file.
A line that prevents malicious activity by controlling the role parameter. Might be able to send a malicious get request with role=admin using Burp.
Doesnt work. Looked around the web found out that a CRLF attack might be suitable here.
Sent a payload &role%0a=Admin, which got me the administrative panel. Woho.
