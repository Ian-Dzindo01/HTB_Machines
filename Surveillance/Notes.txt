Trying dirsearch, dirb and gobuster for enumeration and vhost discovery.
Found and /adming page running a login form built on Craft Cms. Found an exploit for the forgot your password section:
https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166989/Craft-CMS-3.7.36-Password-Reset-Poisoning-Attack.html.
Going to try and get this to work. I will need a email or username of one of the users on the system.
This attack will require the user to click on a link that is sent to their email. Not sure if this is going to work. We try another vector of attack.
By checking the source of the site we see that it is running craftcms version 4.4.14 Found a good python script that will do the job(CVE-2023-41892)
Ran the script, got shell. Looked around, found something interesting in html/craft/storage/backups. Transported the database backup to local machine.
Extracted a hash and a username matthew. Used hashcat to crack the hash and logged in with ssh. Got user flag. Moving on to root.
Ran netstat to see active connections. Seen something active on 8080. Decided for port forwarding, with ssh. Localhost to port 8080 on browser provides us with a login form ran on ZoneMinder.
Found an exploit on metasploit for ZoneMinder - (exploit/unix/webapp/zoneminder_snapshots). Ran that with localhost RPORT 8080 and SVPORT 8081. Got into the system. Ran shell.
Ran sudo -l to see that we have sudo privileges on (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/zm[a-zA-Z]*.pl *
Found database passwod in the /etc/zm.conf file - ZoneMinderPassword2023.
Out of all these files, found out online that zmupdate.pl is exploitable. Placed a shell in the /tmp folder and ran the following:
    sudo /usr/bin/zmupdate.pl --version=1 --user='$(/tmp/shell.sh)' --pass=ZoneMinderPassword2023
Caught the shell with nc and got root flag.
