Trying dirsearch, dirb and gobuster for enumeration and vhost discovery.
Found and /adming page running a login form built on Craft Cms. Found an exploit for the forgot your password section:
https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166989/Craft-CMS-3.7.36-Password-Reset-Poisoning-Attack.html.
Going to try and get this to work. I will need a email or username of one of the users on the system.
This attack will require the user to click on a link that is sent to their email. Not sure if this is going to work. We try another vector of attack.
By checking the source of the site we see that it is running craftcms version 4.4.14
