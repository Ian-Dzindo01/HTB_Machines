Found subdomain dev/devorrtex. Found administrator panel inside of this. Both of these using dirsearch and gobuster. Reached Joomla website, gonna try to hack credentials.

Maybe try this now:
  The attacker exploited a loophole in Joomla and uploaded a PHP file to the images folder.

  The file contained the following SQL statement (in base64 encoded format):

  UPDATE #__users SET username='admin', password='[MD5 value]'

  The PHP file was executed from the attackerâ€™s machine/server using CURL.

  The query ran successfully, and the usernames and passwords for all the users were set to the same value.

Used Joomla version 4.2.6 exploit to obtain login credentials.
Once inside went to System/System Templates and placed a bash reverse shell into the login.php form. Netcat to have command execution.

Once inside the system, opened the lewis user mysql table and extracted password hashes for lewis and logan.

Managed to crack logan user password using john the ripper. Connected to the target machine with ssh using the password we just obtained. Retrieved user flag.
Ran sudo -l, seen that we have user privileges on a file named apport-cli. Simple exploit to gain sudo privileges using - CVE-2023-26604.
