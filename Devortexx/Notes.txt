Found subdomain dev/devorrtex. Found administrator panel inside of this. Both of these using dirsearch and gobuster. Reached Joomla website, gonna try to hack credentials.

Maybe try this now:
  The attacker exploited a loophole in Joomla and uploaded a PHP file to the images folder.

  The file contained the following SQL statement (in base64 encoded format):

  UPDATE #__users SET username='admin', password='[MD5 value]'

  The PHP file was executed from the attackerâ€™s machine/server using CURL.

  The query ran successfully, and the usernames and passwords for all the users were set to the same value.
