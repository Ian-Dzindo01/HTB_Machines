Nmap scan reveals interesting 80 filtered http port. Also port 55555 is open and hosting a service. Might be an interesting way in.
Request baskets is being used, maybe I can manipulate that. Make a basket to talk to local machine port 80.
Following the url we see Mailtrail v0.53 being used. Maybe exploitable.
Found a script, it is in the repo here. Execute script and listen on netcat to get user.
Sudo -l to see that systemctl can be ran as sudo.
Couple of exploits for this, but this command is quickest and most effective. Spawn a shell after executing this command using !sh:
    sudo systemctl status trail.service
Root flag should be in ~.
