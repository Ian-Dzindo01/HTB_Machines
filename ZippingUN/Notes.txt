Inspecting the site we find a couple of interesting findings. /uploads will probably contain any files we upload through the work with us for.
The assets directory also might be useful. Dirsearch shows a login.php site that could be of use.
Gobuster vhost enumeration finished. Nothing to see.
Shopping tab might be interesting too.
Site only accepts pdf files. We might be able to put a revshell inside of a pdf file and upload it.
Ill take some time to learn about the structure of a pdf and writing one from text in order to understand how to put a payload inside.
Bootstrap-4.3.1 is also being used, maybe a way in.
Seems that all the vulnerabilities for bootstrap 4.3.1 were fixed and updated.
Uploading a zip file with a reverse shell or something uncovering the user details is probably our best bet.
Trying to upload an evil zip file but page keeps saying it needs a .pdf extension.
I need a zipped up revershe shell inside of a pdf file.
